  <h1>Prime number checker
  </h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This is a python program that checks if the inputed number is prime. But you may wonder how this works. It works using something called the Miller-Rabin Test. The miller-rabin test is a test that checks whether a number is prime or not. It was made by George Miller and enhanced by Michael Oser Rabin. The test derived from Fermat's test to determine whether or not a number was prime but it had some flaws.</p>
