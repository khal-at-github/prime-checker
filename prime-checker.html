   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>This is a python program that checks if the inputed number is prime. But you may wonder how this works. It works using something called the Miller-Rabin Test. The miller-rabin test is a test that checks whether a number is prime or not. It was made by George Miller and enhanced by Michael Oser Rabin. The test derived from Fermat's test to determine whether or not a number was prime but it had some flaws.</p>

    <h2>Fermat's Little Theorem and it's flaws</h2>
    <p>Fermat's little theorem states that </p>

   <p>The problem with this theorem is that sometimes it did not work. If you plug in n=561 and a=100 it will prove to be false. Here 100 is a liar to 561's primality. You might think that this is only one instance of a base like 100 but most bases are liars when it comes to the primality of 561. Numbers like 561 are called Carmichael numbers which pass Fermat's test unless they share a factor with the number. Paul Erdos conjectured that there were an infinite number of them, and it was proven in 1994 by William Alford, Andrew Granville and Carl Pomerance. </p>

    <h2>Miller-Rabin primality test</h2>
   <p>The python code I have in my git repo choses the base a to be 2 if the number is 3 and otherwise it will chose a number between 2, and the natural log of the number. It then checks if the number is 2 and automatically returns True</p>
